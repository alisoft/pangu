        It is a long established fact that a <strong>reader</strong> will be
        distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its{" "}
        <strong>layout</strong>. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
        more-or-less normal{" "}
        <a href="/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          distribution of letters.
        </a>{" "}

      <ol>
        <li>We want everything to look good out of the box.</li>
        <li>
          Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks
          more realistic than a list with two items.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Typography should be easy</h3>
      <p>
        So that's a header for you â€” with any luck if we've done our job
        correctly that will look pretty reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>Something a wise person once told me about typography is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look
          like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501493870936-9c2e41625521?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1045&q=80"
          alt="nc blog"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Iure vel
          officiis ipsum placeat itaque neque dolorem modi perspiciatis dolor
          distinctio veritatis sapiente
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure
        that looks good, too:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>So here is the first item in this list.</li>
        <li>In this example we're keeping the items short.</li>
        <li>Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And that's the end of this section.</p>
      <h2>Code should look okay by default.</h2>
      <p>
        I think most people are going to use{" "}
        <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or{" "}
        <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or something if they want to
        style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look{" "}
        <em>okay</em> out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final
        sentence can't hurt.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code className="language-js">
          {`function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
} `}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Hopefully that looks good enough to you.</p>
      <h3>We still need to think about stacked headings though.</h3>
      <h4>
        Let's make sure we don't screw that up with <code>h4</code> elements,
        either.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they
        look pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized
        block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I
        have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced
        if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final
        sentence can't hurt.
      </p>
    </>
