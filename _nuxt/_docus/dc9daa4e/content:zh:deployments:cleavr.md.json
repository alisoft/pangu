Fill out the remaining website info and click **Add**.\n\nThis will add the site to your server and configure the server with any missing required environment dependencies.\n\nOnce the site has been successfully added, go to the Web App section and navigate to settings > code repository for the web app that was added.\n\nFill in your version control provider, repository, and branch to deploy fields and then click **Update**.\n\n## Step 2: Deploy\n\nYou're now ready to deploy your web app.\n\nOn the web app's deployment page, click **Deploy**.\n\nThe deployment process will begin and
