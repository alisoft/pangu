You are free to organize your application however you like and can create other directories as and when you need them.\n\n---\n\nLet's create the directories and files that do not exist in our project yet.\n\n```bash\nmkdir components assets static\ntouch nuxt.config.js\n```\n\nThese are the main directories and files that we use when building a Nuxt application. You will find an explanation of each of them below.\n\n::alert{type=\"info\"}\nCreating directories with these names enables features in your Nuxt project.\n::\n\n## Directories\n\n### The pages directory\n\nThe `pages` directory contains your application's views and routes. As you've learned in the last chapter, Nuxt reads all the `.vue` files inside this directory and uses them to create the application router.\n\n::alert{type=\"next\"}\nLearn more about the [pages directory](/docs/directory-structure/pages)\n::\n\n### The components directory\n\nThe `components` directory is where you put all your Vue.js components which are then imported into your pages.\n\nWith Nuxt you can create your components and auto import them into your .vue files meaning there is no need to manually import them in the script section. Nuxt will scan and auto import these for you once you have components set to true.\n\n::alert{type=\"next\"}\nLearn more about the [components directory](/docs/directory-structure/components)\n::\n\n### The assets directory\n\nThe `assets` directory contains your uncompiled assets such as your styles, images, or fonts.\n\n::alert{type=\"next\"}\nLearn more about the [assets directory](/docs/directory-structure/assets)\n::\n\n### The static directory\n\nThe `static` directory is directly mapped to the server root and contains files that have to keep their names (e.g. `robots.txt`) _or_ likely won't change (e.g. the favicon)\n\n::alert{type=\"next\"}\nLearn more about the [static directory](/docs/directory-structure/static)\n::\n\n### The nuxt.config.js file\n\nThe `nuxt.config.js` file is the single point of configuration for Nuxt. If you want to add modules or override default settings, this is the place to apply the changes.\n\n::alert{type=\"next\"}\nLearn more about the [nuxt.config.js file](/docs/directory-structure/nuxt-config)\n::\n\n### The package.json file\n\nThe `package.json` file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your application.\n\n## More about the project structures\n\nThere are more helpful directories and files, including [content](/docs/directory-structure/content), [layouts](/docs/directory-structure/layouts), [middleware](/docs/directory-structure/middleware), [modules](/docs/directory-structure/modules), [plugins](/docs/directory-structure/plugins) and [store](/docs/directory-structure/store) . As they aren't necessary for small applications, they are not covered here.\n\n::alert{type=\"next\"}\nTo learn about all directories in detail, feel free to read the [Directory Structure book](/docs/directory-structure/nuxt).\n::\n","ast":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"prose-h1","props":{"class":"d-heading-title","id":"directory-structure"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Directory Structure"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-paragraph","props":{"class":"d-heading-description"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The default Nuxt application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both small and large applications.
