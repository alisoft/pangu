It is capable of hosting both static and dynamic applications in a variety of languages.\n\nPlatform.sh includes the following features:\n\n- Build, deploy, manage, and scale applications.\n- Any branch can be a staging environment; create and delete environments with ease.\n- Support for almost any Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, or Java application, in your choice of version, or mix and match.\n- Automatic TLS certificates.\n- Integrated build pipeline to customize your application's build process however you need.\n- Infrastructure-as-code: define three YAML files and your entire cluster is created on demand. Add and remove services with ease.\n- Deploy code directly from your GitHub and GitLab repositories.\n\n## Setup\n\nPlatform.sh has a pre-made template for Nuxt available. The link below will create a new Platform.sh project and pre-populate it with a sample Nuxt application that you can then customize.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project?template=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/template-builder/master/templates/nuxtjs/.platform.template.yaml&utm_content=nuxtjs&utm_source=nuxtjs_orgb&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=deploy_on_platform\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg\" alt=\"Deploy on Platform.sh\" height=\"40px\" width=\"180px\" />\n</a>\n</p>\n\nThe `README.md` file includes details of the provided default configuration.
