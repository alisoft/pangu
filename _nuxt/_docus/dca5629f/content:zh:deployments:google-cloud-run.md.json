After the upload, Cloud Build will automatically generate a container. Then we will deploy this container to Google Cloud Run which will start it with the `start` script in our package.json.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nMake sure you have a Google Cloud Account, a project and the accesses as editor on Cloud Build and Cloud Run. Furthermore, make sure to download and install the Cloud SDK (CLI) from Google as explained [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and log into your Google Cloud Account. If you do not want to download the Cloud SDK, be aware that you can use gcloud CLI from the Google Cloud Console.\n\nNow, let's do few checks!\n\nIf the Cloud Build API and the Cloud Run API are not enabled, enable them:\n\n```bash\n# Enabling Cloud Build\n$ gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com\n\n# Enabling Cloud Run\n$ gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com\n```\n\nGo in your application directory and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\n# For yarn users\n$ yarn\n\n# For npm users\n$ npm install\n```\n\nStart the application locally:\n\n```bash\n# For yarn users\n$ yarn dev\n\n# For npm users\n$ npm run dev\n```\n\nCheck that everything works.\n\n## Containerize your application\n\nNow, we will create a container with Cloud Build.\n\nYou need to add to your Nuxt app a `Dockerfile`. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in your root project directory and add the following content:\n\nFor yarn users:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM node:14\n\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\n\nCOPY . ./\nRUN yarn\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nENV HOST=0.0.0.0\nENV PORT=8080\n\nRUN yarn build\n\nCMD [ \"yarn\", \"start\" ]\n```\n\nFor npm users:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM node:14\n\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\n\nCOPY . ./\nRUN npm install\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n\nENV HOST=0.0.0.0\nENV PORT=8080\n\nRUN npm run build\n\nCMD [ \"npm\", \"run\", \"start\" ]\n```\n\nRun the following command to start the build process:\n\n`gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID>/my-nuxt-app-name:1.0.0 .`\n\n!Attention: if you want to implement continuous delivery or .env files configurations, you will have to use a [Cloud Build configuration file](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/build-config).\n\n## Deploying your application on Cloud Run\n\nRun the following command to deploy your application:\n\n`gcloud run deploy --image=gcr.io/<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID>/my-nuxt-app-name:1.0.0 --platform managed --port 3000`\n\nAllow unauthenticated invocations if you want to set up a public access.\n\nBe aware that Cloud Run applications will have a default concurrency value of 80 (each container instance will handle up to 80 requests at a time). You can specify the concurrency value this way:\n\n`gcloud run deploy --image=gcr.io/<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID>/my-nuxt-app-name:1.0.0 --platform managed --port 3000 --concurrency <YOUR_CONCURRENCY_VALUE>`\n\nRun the following command to check if the deployment was created successfully:\n\n`gcloud run services list --platform managed`\n\nA list of Cloud Run services is displayed. Click on the URL of your deployment and enjoy the result!\n","ast":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"prose-h1","props":{"class":"d-heading-title","id":"deploy-nuxt-on-google-cloud-run"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Deploy Nuxt on Google Cloud Run"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-paragraph","props":{"class":"d-heading-description"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How to deploy Nuxt on Google Cloud Run?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-hr","props":{"class":"d-heading-hr"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-paragraph","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"prose-a","props":{"href":"https://cloud.google.com/run","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Google Cloud Run"}]},{"type":"text","value":" is a fully managed compute platform for deploying and scaling containerized applications quickly and securely."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-paragraph","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In this guide, we simply upload the entire project folder to Google Cloud Build with a Dockerfile.
