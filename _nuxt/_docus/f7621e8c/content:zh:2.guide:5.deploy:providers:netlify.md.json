Nuxt will auto-detect that you are in a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) build environment and build the correct version of your Nuxt server. For new sites, Netlify will detect that you are using Nuxt and set the publish directory to `dist` and build command to `npm run build`. If you are upgrading an existing site, you should check these and update them if needed.\n\nTo trigger a deploy, just push to your git repository [as you would normally do for Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/).\n\nBy default, Nuxt will server-render each page on server hit using [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/). You can optionally configure deployment to use [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/) or [Netlify On-demand Builders](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/on-demand-builders/).\n\n## Netlify Edge Functions\n\n[Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/) use [Deno](https://deno.land) and the powerful V8 JavaScript runtime to let you run globally distributed functions for the fastest possible response times. Nuxt output can directly run the server at the edge - closer to your users!\n\nRead more in the [Netlify Edge Functions announcement](https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-serverless-compute-with-edge-functions).\n\n## On-demand Builders\n\n[Netlify On-demand Builders](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/on-demand-builders/) are serverless functions used to generate web content as needed that’s automatically cached on Netlify’s Edge CDN. They enable you to build pages for your site when a user visits them for the first time and then cache them at the edge for subsequent visits (also known as Incremental Static Regeneration).\n\n## Custom Redirects\n\nIf you want to add custom redirects, you can do so by adding a [`_redirects`](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file) file in the [`public`](/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.\n\n## Learn More\n\n:ReadMore{link=\"https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/netlify.html\" title=\"the Nitro documentation for Netlify deployment\"}\n","ast":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"prose-h1","props":{"class":"d-heading-title","id":"netlify"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Netlify"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-paragraph","props":{"class":"d-heading-description"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How to deploy Nuxt to "},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-a","props":{"href":"https://www.netlify.com/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Netlify"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"list","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"prose-ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"text","value":"Support for serverless SSR using Netlify Functions and Edge"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"text","value":"Auto-detected when deploying"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"text","value":"No configuration required"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-h2","props":{"id":"setup"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"prose-a","props":{"href":"#setup"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Setup"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"prose-paragraph","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Normally, the deployment to Netlify does not require any configuration.
