It is dynamically generated and hidden by default. Inside the directory you can find automatically generated files when using `nuxt dev` or your build artifacts when using `nuxt build`. Modifying these files is great for debugging but remember that they are generated files and once you run the `dev` or `build` command again, anything that was saved here will be regenerated.\n\n---\n\n::alert{type=\"warning\"}\nThe `.nuxt` directory should not be committed to your version control system and should be ignored through your `.gitignore` as it will be generated automatically when executing `nuxt dev` or `nuxt build`.\n::\n\n### The buildDir Property\n\nBy default, many tools assume that `.nuxt` is a hidden directory, because its name starts with a dot. You can use the buildDir option to prevent that. If you do change the name remember to add the new name to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n```js{}[nuxt.config.js]\nexport default {\n  buildDir: 'nuxt-dist'\n}\n```\n\n### Inside the .nuxt folder:\n\n- The router.js file is the generated router file that Nuxt generates for you when you put `.vue` files inside the pages folder. You can use this file for debugging for when you want to look up which routes are generated for vue-router and find out the names of a specific route.\n- The router.scrollBehavior.js which is your Router ScrollBehavior\n- The Components folder has all your Nuxt components such as NuxtChild and NuxtLink. It also contains the nuxt-build-indicator which is the page we see when your application is building and nuxt-loading which is your loading component that gets seen when we are waiting for your page to load. You will also find the nuxt-error page in here which contains the Nuxt default error page.\n- The mixins folder has the files needed for the Nuxt `$fetch` method.\n- The views folder contains your app template and your server error page.\n- The app.js is your main application file.\n- The client.js file is your client file needed for everything that happens client side.\n- The empty file is intentionally left empty for no-op aliases\n- The index.js file bootstraps your application.\n- The loading.html is the file that is used when the page is loading.\n- The middleware file is where your middleware is kept\n- The server.js file is all the code that is ran on the server\n- the utilities contains the utilities that Nuxt needs for it to work.\n\n### Deploying\n\nThe `.nuxt` folder is part of the files needed to deploy your SSR application. It is not needed for deploying your static Nuxt app though because we use the `dist` folder for that.\n",ast:{type:"root",children:[{type:b,tag:"prose-h1",props:{class:"d-heading-title",id:"nuxt-build-directory"},children:[{type:a,value:v}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:k,props:{class:"d-heading-description"},children:[{type:a,value:n},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:i}]},{type:a,value:" directory is the so-called "},{type:b,tag:"prose-em",props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"build directory"}]},{type:a,value:".
