But don't worry! We're a friendly community of developers and we'd love to help.\n\n## \"I can't figure out how to __.\"\n\nYou've read through these docs and you think it should be possible, but it's not clear how. The best thing is to [open a GitHub Discussion](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnuxt\u002Fframework\u002Fdiscussions).\n\nPlease don't feel embarrassed about asking a question that you think is easy - we've all been there! ❤️\n\nEveryone you'll encounter is helping out because they care, not because they are paid to do so. The kindest thing to do is make it easy for them to help you. Here are some ideas:\n\n* _Explain what your objective is, not just the problem you're facing._ \"I need to ensure my form inputs are accessible, so I'm trying to get the ids to match between server and client.\"\n\n* _Make sure you've first read the docs and used your favorite search engine_. Let people know by saying something like \"I've Googled for 'nuxt script setup' but I couldn't find code examples anywhere.\"\n\n* _Explain what you've tried._ Tell people the kind of solutions you've experimented with, and why. Often this can make people's advice more relevant to your situation.\n\n* _Share your code._ People probably won't be able to help if they just see an error message or a screenshot - but that all changes if you share your code in a copy\u002Fpasteable format - preferably in the form of a minimal reproduction like a CodeSandbox.\n\nAnd finally, just ask the question! There's no need to [ask permission to ask a question](https:\u002F\u002Fdontasktoask.com\u002F) or [wait for someone to reply to your 'hello'](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nohello.com\u002F). If you do, you might not get a response because people are waiting for the whole question before engaging.\n\n## \"Could there be a bug?\"\n\nSomething isn't working the way that the docs say that it should. You're not sure if it's a bug. You've searched through the [open issues](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnuxt\u002Fframework\u002Fissues) and [discussions](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnuxt\u002Fframework\u002Fdiscussions) but you can't find anything.
